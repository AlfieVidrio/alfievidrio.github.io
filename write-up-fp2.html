            <h1>Overview & Usage</h1>
            <span>The final version of the application is much simpler than what I originally set out to make, 
                but I am nevertheless proud of the work that went into it and its overall efficiency in finding 
                drinks that match the search queries that are passed through.

            <h1>Development Proces</h1>
            <span>The development process was long and arduous. I spend many hours simply 
                trying to format the JSON into something usable. I also spent a significant 
                amount of time redesigning the application to better align with the functionality 
                that I felt would be easier to implement. I was ultimately unable to implement 
                my new design or any recipe functionality, as I had originally hoped. 
                <br><br>
                The process since the last version was mostly a trial and error approach to 
                development. I would play with the code, see what changed, and make decisions 
                based on that. I also used google to search for resources, which varied from very 
                helpful to completely irrelevant. 
                <br><br>
                In the last phase of the project, I chose to focus on the main functionality (search). 
                I simplified the code as much as I could and made it easier to search for something 
                without having to use a “submit” button. The design language that I designed was partly 
                implemented as well. </span>

            <h1>Issue Deep-Dive</h1>
            <span>One issue that I kept having was an “Uncaught (in promise)” error. 
                I did not know what caused this error. I searched for explanations for 
                why this error occurred and that lead me to look closer at the lines of 
                the code that it were causing the issue.

                alt ="Image of the error that I spent hours working through">   
                After closer analysis, I realized that there were typos in my code. So that 
                was rather unfortunate as I wasted quite a long time just trying to understand 
                the error type. </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ideas and Future Work</h1>
            <span>The obvious next steps are to actually implement the functionality 
                that I had planned, like loading the recipes and allowing for 
                ingredient-based search queries. 
                <br><br>
                These updates would require a significant level of commitment that I am 
                not ready to make during my last quarter at UW. However, I do think that 
                this is something that I will consider expanding on at a later time. </span>

            <h1>Kudos</h1>
            <span>
                I would like to give major Kudos to the instruction team for their 
                support throughout the process. I feel like I made the most progress 
                during our 1:1 meetings. So thank you so much, Hannah & Raina.

                Additionally, I would like to thank the members of my capstone group, 
                Frannie, Han, and Ryan, for allowing me to share the WIP versions of 
                my application. They helped me test it, made suggestions for refinement, 
                and were always supportive of me.
