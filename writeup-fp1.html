            <h1>Overview and Usage</h1>
            <span>
                This is a working prototype for a cocktail app. Currently, 
                it only allows the user to search for drinks based on a 
                search query. This prototype does not feature all of the 
                functionality that is planned for the final build. It is, 
                however, a MVP that shows that the application has been 
                deployed, is making API calls, and generating an HTML output.

          <h1>Development Process</h1>
          <span>
            I began by working through Hannah’s “example-fetch” example 
            and basically playing with the code using console.log() 
            to test was happening at particular places in the code. 
            This allowed me to understand how to make API calls, format 
            the result into JSON, and then use the JSON to generate an HTML 
            template containing information from the API (see image below for
            what the app looked like at this stage). 
            <img class="image"
            style="max-width: 500px; display: block;"
            src="./cocktail-progress-1.png"
            alt="Preview of what the application looked like prior to having a search function"
            />
            I then changed the API being called to the Cocktail API, which 
            is the API my app will use. Once the code was calling the API 
            correctly, I added a search bar and button to allow users to enter 
            the search query (I had previously been hard-coding it in the JS). 
          </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Issue Deep-Dive </h1>
            <span>
                One major issue that I encountered was getting the fetch function 
                to properly call the Cocktail API. This resulted in nothing loading 
                on the HTML, except for the title. This problem persisted for quite 
                some time.
            <img class="image"
            style="max-width: 500px; display: block;"
            src="./cocktail-error-1.png"
            alt="Image of an error I kept encountering"
            />
                Honestly, I don’t know how I got it to work. I just played with the 
                code and then googled what the error messages meant. I also used 
                ChatGPT to explain to me what certain lines of code were doing,
                which did help me understand what was happening.

            <h1>Future Work</h1>
            <span>
                Obviously, this prototype is far from being done. I still have a lot to add, 
                but I want to focus on getting the bare-bones HTML and JS working so that I 
                can then focus on styling it with CSS. My proposal details everything I plan 
                on incorporating.
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Kudos</h1>
            <span>
                I would like to give major kudos to Hannah, whose code I used as the foundation
                for my app. I would also like to give Kudos to Frannie and Arissa, who informed
                me that vite did not require rollup. I was very confused about this, so it was
                very appreciated.
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Project Scope</h1>
            <span>
                The overall project concept has not changed. I still want the application to do 
                the same things, i.e., still a search engine for cocktail recipes with a focus 
                on the ingredients in the drinks. 
                However, I quickly realized that my development approach was flawed. I did not know 
                how to make API calls using JS and my currently knowledge of how that is done has 
                changed how I will continue to develop the application. 
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Time Management</h1>
            <span>
                I have spent significantly more time simply getting the MVP to work than I initially 
                anticipated. Collecting the search query via the HTML, transmitting that to the API, 
                accessing the relevant information inside the JSON, and then exporting it back to the 
                HTML was much harder than I thought. Now that I understand those components work, I 
                have a better understanding of much time I will need to complete the project.  
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Implementation Plan</h1>
            <span>
                As previously mentioned, my approach to development was incorrect and forced me completely 
                rethink the process. I now have a better understanding of what I need to do:
                <ul>
                    <li>Establish link between search results and results page</li>
                    <li>Generate recipe HTML pages</li>
                    <li>Format everything in mobile-friendly CSS</li>
                </ul>
            </span>
