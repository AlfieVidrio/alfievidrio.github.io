            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <span>
                <ol>
                    <li>I began by simply laying out a basic HTML structure and assigning them style classes that I could use to format 
                        them very basically. See the following Screenshot to see what that version looked like.</li>
                    <li>I then created the necessary pages. </li> 
                    <li>I continued by playing with HTML tags and CSS styles to see what I liked. </li>
                    <li>I then added content to each of the pages that I created.</li>
                    <li>I finished by updating the pages to make sure everything was formated similarly.</li>
                </ol> 
            </span>
            <span><b>Screenshot of First Home Page:</b><br><br></span>
            <img class="image" style="border: 1px solid #000; border-radius: 20px; margin-left: 30px; width: 200px;"
            src="./screen-shot.png"
            alt="Very lo-fi version of the portfolio"
            />
        </div>
        <h1>Issue</h1>
        <span>The largest issue that I had was with embedding an image onto the website. I first tried to link an image off the web, 
            but this did not work. I then realized that I could upload the image directly into the repository. This solved my issue.
        </span>
        <h1>CSS Transition</h1>
        <span>I added a transition to the buttons that I created; the text and background colors swap when hovered over.
        </span>
        <h1>Ideas and Future</h1>
        <span>
            <ul>
                <li>More aesthetically pleasing layout</li>
                <li>Better use of space</li>
                <li>Clear navigation throughout website</li>
                <li>Use more appropriate HTML tags for elements & content!!!</li>
            </ul>
