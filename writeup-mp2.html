            <h1>Overview and Usage</h1>
            <span>This project explores how p5.js can be used to create interactive
                graphical elements. I drew inspiration from the rhodonea curve (rose).
            </span>
            <h1>Development Process</h1>
            <span>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, I explored what kinds of mathematical formulas could be used 
                        to draw shapes inside the p5.js website editor. That lead me to a 
                        CodingTrain video describing the formula for a rhodonea curve, which 
                        helped me develop my first sketch. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I then formatted the rose to be more aesthetically pleasing to me. 
                        Sketches 2–3 were easy to iterate on by simply looking at the 
                        documentation available on the p5.js website. See below for an early
                        black and white color scheme.
                    </li>
                    <img class="image"
                    style="max-width: 500px; display: block;"
                    src="./mp2-progress.png"
                    alt ="Progress photo of one of the designs"
                    />
                    <li>
                        Sketches 4–5 required me to look at more CodingTrain videos 
                        regarding how sound was generated using p5.js, but I was quickly
                        able to iterate on my designs to meet the assignment brief. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I then created individual html pages to host each of the sketches 
                        and added them to my website repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I concluded the project by creating the gallery using a flex-box.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </span>
            <h1>Issue Deep-Dive</h1>
            <span>
                I fortunately did not experience any significant problems, or at least, not any 
                problems that quick google searches did not help address. Early on, however, I 
                was repeatedly having issues regarding how variables were being declared–
                specifically, problems with scope. See the sample error below message (1 of many).
            </span>
            <img class="image"
            style="max-width: 500px; display: block;"
            src="./mp02-issue.png"
            alt="Image of issue that I had while designing"
            />
            <span>
                Hannah helped me address this issue by first establishing a variable using the 
                keyword “let” and then defining it later, when/where it would be used. After 
                receiving this help, I did not encounter this issue again.
            </span>
            <h1>Future Work</h1>
            <span>
                If I were to continue working on this project, I would try to see how I could 
                create multiple roses within a single canvas, or perhaps play with how they 
                interact with one another. It would also be fun to simply play around with p5.js 
                and try something completely new. 
            </span>
            <h1>Kudos</h1>
            <span>
                I relied heavily on the resources provided by the CodingTrain, so I must give them the most kudos. 
                I would also like to thank my instructor, Hannah, for help with debugging and general information 
                regarding p5.js. Additionally, I would like to give kudos to Tim Chen, who explained to me how to 
                access the html/css files associated with a p5.js sketch inside the online editor.
