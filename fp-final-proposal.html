            <span>
                Cocktail Manager is an application that will help users find new 
                cocktails based on search queries like cocktail ingredients or 
                cocktail glass type.

            <h1>Project Versions</h1>
            <span>
                <b>Prototype version:</b> My goal for this version of the 
                application is to have a working code that makes calls to 
                the API and inserts them into an HTML template. The CSS styling 
                will not be ready at this time and the HTML will likely be very 
                basic.
                <br><br>
                <b>Final version:</b> The final version of the application will 
                be able to accept user input and generate a list of suitable 
                results. The CSS will style the content so that it is suitable 
                for both mobile and desktop. 
            </span>
            <h1>Development Steps</h1>
            <span>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first step will be adapting the existing 
                        Python code into Javascript so that it is more 
                        suitable for working with responsive HTML templates. 
                        The basic logic and calls to the API will likely be 
                        the same, with minor modifications to increase overall 
                        efficiency (i.e., reduce the number of API calls). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The next step will be getting the code to 
                        correctly output the results of the API calls 
                        into HTML tagsâ€“not necessarily in the final 
                        formatting. This will be to test that the overall 
                        template functionality is working properly. <b>This
                        will be milestone #1 (prototype).</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, I will be working on implementing the 
                        CSS formatting with a focus on making the application 
                        suitable for both mobile and desktop views. <b>This
                        will be milestone #2 (final version).</b> 
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </span>
            <h1>Known Unknowns</h1>
            <span>
                <b>Unknowns:</b>

                    <li>How to use HTML templates to generate website

            </span>
            <h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
            <span>
                I may consider adding advanced search functionality. For
                example, allowing the user to input a list of ingredients 
                they already have and the app informing the user which 
                ingredients they would still need to get.
